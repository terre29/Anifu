# Anifu

Hello! Welcome to my so called self-project repository.

As iOS Developer, it is been so long that I wanted to have my personal app on AppStore, so here I'm creating my first self project. It's still far from a perfect and good app
but hey, inspiration comes when you are doing, not thinking. Also I believe continous improvement is better than deleyed prefection. 

It is called Anifu because you see a lot of series of Anime in my app. Anifu is powered byJ ikan API https://jikan.moe

So what Anifu does?
* You can search anime series in Anifu 
* You can save anime series to your watch list and remind you to watch it
* You can see anime detail, such as its rating, score, related character, voice actor, and many more!

What technolgy does Anifu have?
* Core data, to store user watch list and their profile
* Infinite of Scrolling! Yes you can infinitely scroll the anime list from the list
* Push notification, to notify the user when they watch time is near
* Reactive Programming, using RxSwift
* MVVM

What have been done? <br>
✅ Implement browse anime screen <br>
✅ Implement anime detail screen <br>
✅ Implement profile screen <br>
✅ Implement core data integration <br>

What haven't been done? <br>
❌ Implement push notification <br>
❌ Save anime watchlist <br>
❌ Implement anime watchlist page <br>
<br>
Thats it for the project, still many things to be done :)
